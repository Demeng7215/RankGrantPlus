# This is where you can customize basically everything that has to do with ranks in RankGrant+. #
# Everything in this file should be clearly explained. For questions, use the support options.
# Thank you for using RankGrant+!

# This is a very important configuration section if you DO NOT WANT TO AUTO-LIST RANKS.
# This is where you list all your ranks and customize each rank item in the GUI.
# To add a rank, simply start a new configuration section by the name of the group in your permission plugin.
# Then, fill out the slot, item, name, lore, and special permission required to grant this rank.
